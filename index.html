<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am Noor</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
  
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I am a third year computer science student at Pitt, I initally intended on majoring in psychology but realized it was more a hobby than a passion. My father is a computer science professor and my whole family in some way shape or form has dabbled in the feild. So I had a lot of
  guidance when making the decision to switch. I hope to work as a software engineer and/or down the line in project managment.</h3>

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>I consider myself a thinker and a maker. With my background in computer science and digital narrative, I enjoy exploring how technology and storytelling intersect. My medium tends to be digital design, where I can experiment with user interfaces and interactive narratives. I’m interested in how design can influence the way people experience stories, particularly in web development and app design. In this class, I’m excited to learn more about blending written narratives with visual elements, and I hope to develop skills in graphic design and creative writing.</h3>

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is good design?</h2>
      <h3>
        A good digital design should be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. It needs to effectively communicate the intended message while being easy to navigate and use. Simplicity is key—users should intuitively understand how to interact with the design without feeling overwhelmed. Good use of color, typography, and spacing is important to guide the user's attention. Consistency across elements helps build trust, and responsiveness ensures the design works well on different devices. </h3>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements-field of study, home and family, interests and activities? How might the work we do in this space help you to realize this future?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>After school, I hope to pursue a career in project management, particularly in the tech industry. I have always found myself in leadership roles, whether in academic settings or during my internship with UPMC, where I was appointed team lead. This experience only assured me that I thrive in environments where I can guide teams and see projects through to completion. My computer science degree aligns perfectly with this path, as it gives me the technical background to manage software projects. Having grown up in a family deeply rooted in the field of computer science, I have always been drawn to the world of tech, and project management allows me to combine my leadership skills with my passion for technology. The work we do in this course—integrating writing, design, and communication will help me gain the skills in this endevour, allowing me to better articulate ideas and strategies to diverse teams and groups.</h3>
